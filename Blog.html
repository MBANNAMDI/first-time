      <p> <b>GSDs are incredibly smart:</b><br>
      <div style="font-size: 20pt;font-weight:lighter">If you’re a German Shepherd owner, you have a strong suspicion
        your dog might actually be smarter than you are. After all, what can’t your dog do? These dogs are known for
        their intelligence and many can learn a new behavior in only a few repetitions. In addition, they have a
        legendary desire to cooperate and work with us, a trait many see as a wish to please their humans. No wonder
        this breed excels at so many activities and is a top Obedience competitor. Because German Shepherds are one of
        the brightest breeds, be sure to be consistent, use positive reinforcement-based methods, provide plenty of
        mentally stimulating toys, and play brain-challenging games.</div>

      <img src="img/dog9.jpg" width="280pt" height="200pt" alt=""><br>
      <p> <b>German Shepherd Dogs are known for their versatility:</b>
      <div style="font-size: 20pt;font-weight:lighter">If you need any job done, just ask your dog. GSD owners
        understand their dogs were developed as working dogs. In fact, the ideal German Shepherd has a body and gait
        suited to the hard work that is considered its primary purpose. This means your dog can excel at almost
        anything. From dog sports like rally, agility, scent work, therapy work, to service dog work, German Shepherds
        can do it all. The only thing holding your dog back is the time and energy you can commit to training. It’s no
        wonder people always think your dog is a service or police dog.</div>
      </p>
      <li><b style="font-size:20pt ;">THE SUPER ACTIVE DOG</b></li>
      <img src="img/dog6.jpg" width="280pt" height="200pt" alt=""><br>
      <P><b>GSDs are super active:</b><br>
      <div style="font-size: 20pt;font-weight:lighter">Therefore, so are you. Thinking of lounging on the couch? No way!
        German Shepherd owners know that won’t happen until you’ve walked your dog, gone to the park, or provided some
        sort of exercise. This breed only thrives with enough regular exercise to burn off all that excess energy. If
        you don’t give your GSD daily workouts, watch out. Your dog will get that energy out somehow, and most likely in
        ways you don’t want. To be sure your German Shepherd is happy and a pleasure to live with, you will definitely
        get all the exercise you need too.</div>
